    when we are building the application then the bulder will do compress the code , the compressed code information will save in the Dist folder. this file can be automatically genarate when we building the application.

=> what is 'browserlists'?
    browserlist is a package  it will help run our app is older verstions of browsers, to configure we need to add a "browserslist" in the package.json with list of verstion of the browsers.



///////// jsx/////

 The type attribute identifies the content between the <script> and </script> tags.

 4. {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>}vs{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}in jsx?
 => The Difference is stated below: {TitleComponent} : This value describes the TitleComponent as a javascript expression or a variable. 
 The {} can embed a javascript expression or a variable inside it. 
 <TitleComponent/> : This value represents a Component that is basically returning Some JSX value.
 {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} : This value also represents a Component that is basically returning Some JSX value.
 we can add elements between these two tags.
